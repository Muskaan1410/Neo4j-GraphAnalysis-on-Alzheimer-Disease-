# Neo4j-GraphAnalysis-on-Alzheimer-Disease

Project Overview
This project delves into the field of graph databases and their applications, specifically focusing on the utilization of Neo4j and the Hetionet dataset. Our primary objective is to develop a comprehensive Knowledge Graph that enables the exploration and analysis of complex relationships within biomedical data.

Key Highlights
Development of a Comprehensive Knowledge Graph:
We leveraged the Hetionet dataset to construct a detailed Knowledge Graph using Neo4j, a leading graph database management system. Hetionet provides a rich source of biomedical data, allowing us to model the intricate relationships between various entities, such as diseases, genes, and compounds.

Focus on Alzheimerâ€™s Disease:
The project specifically focuses on Alzheimer's disease, a prevalent and complex neurodegenerative disorder. By employing advanced Graph Algorithms within Neo4j, we aim to identify and analyze the precise genes associated with Alzheimer's disease. This includes investigating upregulated, downregulated, and other disease-related genes to gain deeper insights into the condition.

Technologies and Tools
Neo4j: Utilized for creating and querying the Knowledge Graph.
Hetionet Dataset: A comprehensive biomedical dataset (https://het.io/) used as the foundation for the Knowledge Graph.
Graph Algorithms: Applied within Neo4j to perform advanced analyses and identify key genetic associations related to Alzheimer's disease.
This project represents a significant step towards harnessing the power of graph databases and knowledge graphs in the biomedical domain. By focusing on Alzheimer's disease and utilizing state-of-the-art tools and datasets, we aim to contribute to the understanding of this complex condition and potentially identify new avenues for research and treatment.
